# wholepigeon

The website for Wholepigeon Embroidery.

To be implemented:

- [X] Custom layout
- [X] Color scheme
~~- [ ] Fixed hamburger menu - responsive? // cancelled~~
- [ ] Forms! Probably via Netlify or just a Google Form link (but that's no fun.) // Google Form
- [ ] Actual copy and images

To fix:

- [ ] Unrotated SVGs in the url() for top `background-image`s.
- [ ] Spacing in the footer with the new links
